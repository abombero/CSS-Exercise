   <h2>Description</h2>

   <p>This recipe was handed down to me by my mother. It is a Dutch favorite on New Year's Day. I spent New Year's Day with my in-laws for the first time and brought this tradition with me. They were very impressed with this delicious doughnut-like treat.</p>

   <h2>Ingredients</h2>

   <ul>
      <li>2 (.25 ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
      <li>½ cup lukewarm water (110 degrees F to 115 degrees F)</li>
      <li>4½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
   </ul>

   <h2>Steps</h2>

   <ol>
      <li>Warm oven on lowest possible temperature setting.</li>
      <li>Dissolve the yeast in the warm water in a small mixing bowl. In a large mixing bowl, combine flour, sugar, and salt. Add the eggs, yeast mixture, and milk; beat with an electric mixer until blended.</li>
      <li>Turn off the oven. Cover the prepared dough with a greased piece of plastic wrap, and place the bowl of dough on the lowest rack of the warmed oven. Allow to rest and rise for 1 hour.</li>
   </ol>
